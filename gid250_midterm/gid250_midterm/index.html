    <p class="under">The project is based on my experience as a student data analyst and explores why being a data analyst excites me. I discussed my top five reasons for my enthusiasm in this field. Throughout the assignment, I learned a great deal about myself and what I enjoy most about pursuing a career as a data analyst. I also gained valuable experience working in Adobe Rush, where I discovered my strengths as a data analyst as well as areas where I need to improve my skills.</p>

    <p class="under">Throughout this assignment, I learned how to use Photoshop to change still images into moving images ready to be animated. I also explored the use of compositions in After Effects, which allowed me to create a structured and layered animation. After establishing the base animation, I added engaging features such as motion, blinking, and even the ability for the dragon and niblet to wave, bringing them to life in a dynamic and interactive way.</p>

    <p class="under">In the final project, I decided to create a website on the following topics: about me, my travel blog, career path and more. While working on the website, I learned a lot about myself. I discovered the things I have passion for, enhanced my understanding of my skills, and identified areasI need to improveon moving forward in my career. This video will explain more about how the website was created in Adobe Dreamweaver. For more on what I created on the site,
